**Solving Approach:**
1. Solve each clue to get hidden words in the grid
2. Find those words in the word search
3. Water droplets mark extraction letters
4. Extract marked letters to spell the answer word

**Clue Analysis:**
- "A cold noise?" → BRRR or CHATTER

### PUZZLE 2: "Changing the Lives of 600 Strangers" — LETTER SUDOKU
**Source:** Reddit (BeastForce67)
**Type:** 9×9 Sudoku using letters C, H, A, N, G, E, L, I, F instead of 1-9
**Expected Answer:** One word extracted from completed grid

**What I See:**
- Standard 9×9 Sudoku grid with pre-filled letters
- Letters used: C, H, A, N, G, E, L, I, F (= "LIFE" + "CHANGE")
- Blue text at bottom: "C H A N G E"
- Blue text on right side: "L I F E" (but showing "L I F F" — possible extraction)
- The "E" in CHANGE at bottom is highlighted differently (cyan)

**Grid (pre-filled cells, row by row from top):**
```
Row 1: _, L, _, _, _, N, _, G, _
Row 2: C, _, _, _, I, _, N, _, _
Row 3: _, I, _, _, _, L, _, F, _
Row 4: G, _, _, _, E, _, C, _, _
Row 5: _, H, _, _, _, A, _, E, _
Row 6: F, _, _, _, N, _, I, _, _
Row 7: _, F, _, _, _, G, _, I, _
Row 8: N, _, _, _, L, _, A, _, _
Row 9: _, C, _, _, _, H, _, N, _
```

**Solving Approach:**
1. Complete the Sudoku (each row, column, and 3×3 box contains each of C,H,A,N,G,E,L,I,F exactly once)
2. The blue "CHANGE" at bottom and "LIFE" on right side suggest extraction rows/columns
3. Read specific cells (likely the diagonal, or cells corresponding to CHANGE/LIFE positions)

**Community Status:** Reportedly solved. The extracted word contributes to the meta-clue.

### PUZZLE 4: "$1 to $500,000 Experiences!" — STENCIL LOCATION PUZZLE
**Source:** ImageShack (BeastForce67)
**Type:** Visual identification — stencil/cutout font names that are neighborhood/location names
**Expected Answer:** One word

**What I See:**
- Subtitle: "I went all over the world for these experiences. Where did I go?"
- 22 name plates in various colors with stencil-style fonts:

```
GLENCA.RY      (red)
WASCANY         (red/orange)    ONTFEL        (green)
WESTASKA        (red)           CAMOIN        (green/blue)
              LSIPAIZER       (blue)
MCOLLY          (blue)         F.LIRSKA      (purple)
              CHALOGEN        (yellow)
KLCHANON        (green)        COLFAX        (yellow)
              JUASDFZOYAS     (purple)
              DOVERCOURT      (blue)
GROCKFGREST     (green)
              MALIAAGLEN      (blue)
MCGLICKIAN      (red)
AALVISO         (blue)         LOSTHER       (red)
ATCIPSCY        (pink)         BINTOS        (yellow)
              CLOMCGREGOY     (red/pink)
```

**Solving Approach:**
These appear to be **neighborhood or suburb names** with extra letters inserted (the stencil "cutout" letters may form a hidden message). The question "Where did I go?" suggests identifying the base location names and extracting the extra letters.

**Possible base neighborhood names (real places):**
- GLENCA.RY → GLENCAIRN (neighborhood in various cities)
- WASCANY → WASCANA (Regina, Saskatchewan)
- WESTASKA → WESTASKWIN? or WEST + ASKA
- MCOLLY → MOLLY? McCOLLY?
- CHALOGEN → CHALONER? 
- KLCHANON → KILCHANON? SHANNON?
- COLFAX → COLFAX (real place in many US cities)
- DOVERCOURT → DOVERCOURT (real place in Toronto/Essex)
- GROCKFGREST → ROCKCREST? 
- MALIAAGLEN → MALAHIDE + GLEN? MALIN? AGLEN?
- MCGLICKIAN → McGLICK? 
- AALVISO → ALVISO (real neighborhood in San Jose, CA)
- LOSTHER → LOSTHERE? LOSTWITHIEL?
- ATCIPSCY → ATTIC? GYPSY?
- BINTOS → BINTON? BINTO?
- CLOMCGREGOY → McGREGOR + extra letters
- ONTFEL → ??? 
- CAMOIN → CAMOIN (real place near Marseille, France)
- LSIPAIZER → SPITALIZER? LSIP + AIZER?
- F.LIRSKA → FLIRSKAR?
- JUASDFZOYAS → JUAS DF ZOYAS?

**Key Insight:** Each name plate likely contains a real neighborhood name + extra inserted letters. The extra letters, read in order, spell the answer word. The different COLORS may group them or indicate reading order.

**Status:** UNSOLVED/PARTIALLY SOLVED. This is a critical puzzle. The answer should be a 5, 7, 8, or 9-letter word (based on remaining meta-clue slots).

### PUZZLE 5: "Pokémon Go Stereotypes" — CAGE BAR MAZE
**Source:** Photobucket (BeastForce67)
**Type:** Pathfinding/maze using Pokémon Pokédex numbers as cage bars
**Expected Answer:** One word

**What I See:**
- Title: "POKÉMON GO STEREOTYPES"
- Flavor text: "The Guy Who Will Do Anything has been caged by these Pokémon. He cannot get out."
- Large grid (~20×20) with a running figure (🏃) in the center
- Below: "Cage Bars:" with numbered bars showing blue-highlighted cells

**Cage Bar Numbers (Pokédex entries):**
Left column bars: 142, 200, 261, 343, 439, 696, 803
Center column bars: 947, 961, 1006, 138, 148, 175, 266
Right column (short bars): 276, 441, 799, 852

**Pokédex Identification:**
- 142 → AERODACTYL (10 letters)
- 200 → MISDREAVUS (10 letters)
- 261 → POOCHYENA (9 letters)
- 343 → BALTOY (6 letters)
- 439 → MIME JR. (6 letters)
- 696 → TYRUNT (6 letters)
- 803 → POIPOLE (7 letters)
- 947 → CAPSAKID (8 letters) [Gen 9]
- 961 → TINKATINK (9 letters) [Gen 9]
- 1006 → IRON VALIANT (11 letters) [Gen 9]
- 138 → OMANYTE (7 letters)
- 148 → DRAGONAIR (9 letters)

- 276 → TAILLOW (7 letters)
- 441 → CHATOT (6 letters)
- 799 → GUZZLORD (8 letters)
- 852 → CLOBBOPUS (9 letters)

**Solving Approach:**
1. Each Pokémon name becomes a "bar" placed on the grid (horizontal or vertical)
2. Bar lengths correspond to name lengths
3. Blue-highlighted cells within each bar indicate extraction letters
4. Place all bars to form cage walls around the running figure
5. Either: trace the escape path, or extract blue-cell letters from Pokémon names

**Blue cell positions within bars (from image):**
- 142 (AERODACTYL): cells ~2,5,8 highlighted
- 200 (MISDREAVUS): cells ~3,7 highlighted
- etc. (need higher-res image for exact positions)

**Status:** PARTIALLY SOLVED. Community identifies this as a pathfinding + extraction puzzle.

### PUZZLE 6: "$10,000 Every Day You Survive in the Wilderness" — TENTS AND TREES
**Source:** X/Twitter BeastForce67, Feb 6, 2026 (91 likes, 11 comments)
**Type:** Tents and Trees logic puzzle with border constraints
**Expected Answer:** One word

**What I See:**
- Rules:
  - "You're alone in the wilderness with limited supplies."
  - "Pitch exactly one tent horizontally or vertically by each tree."
  - "No tent can touch any other tent, even diagonally."
  - "A number outside the wilderness shows how many tents are in that direction."
- 16×16 grid with trees (🌳) scattered throughout and numbers 1-9 in cells
- Right-side tent counts: 4, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3
- Bottom tent counts: 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3

**Solving Approach:**
1. Solve the Tents and Trees puzzle (place tents adjacent to trees, matching row/column counts)
2. Once solved, tent positions on numbered cells → extract those numbers
3. Numbers → A1Z26 cipher → letters → answer word
4. OR: Empty cells after tent placement form a pattern/word

**Status:** Standard logic puzzle, solvable with patience. The answer extraction method is the key question.

### PUZZLE 7: "I Adopted 100 Dogs!" — VENN DIAGRAM LOGIC
**Source:** Pixelfed (BeastForce67, posted Mon Feb 09 2026 5:06:17 PM)
**Type:** Visual identification + Venn diagram extraction
**Expected Answer:** One word

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** "Please note: this file has changed since the initial upload. The sixth doggo in the sixth row is no longer wagging their tail." — This errata is crucial!

**What I See:**
- 100 cartoon dogs in a 10×10 grid
- Each dog varies in 5 visual attributes:
  1. **Ears up** (vs. floppy)
  2. **Has toy bone** (vs. no bone)
  3. **Has spots** (vs. plain)
  4. **Wearing collar** (vs. no collar)
  5. **Wiggling tail** (vs. still tail)
- Left side: Venn diagram with 5 overlapping circles, labeled with letters at intersection regions
- The Venn diagram circles are labeled: S, E, K, W (and others at intersections) — letters at each intersection region

**Solving Approach:**
1. Examine all 100 dogs for each of the 5 attributes
2. Categorize each dog by which attributes they have
3. Count how many dogs fall in each Venn region
4. The letters at Venn intersection points, selected by dog counts, spell the answer
5. **REMEMBER the errata:** Dog 6,6 (row 6, column 6) NO LONGER wags tail — this changes one count!

**Visible Venn Diagram Letters (partial from image):**
The circles seem to be labeled with single letters at various intersection regions. I can see: S, E, K, W, L, P, U, I, X, O, D, G (need higher resolution to confirm all)

**Status:** PARTIALLY SOLVED. "MrBeastHunt" commented "We solved this already, join the server" linking to Discord.

  With two letters highlighted in RED: the X (position 2) and A (position 5/within CHAIRS)

**Hidden words in the string:**
- Z**X**PCH**A**IRSQUORUMSFLAMINGOPUSHCONVEXOFWEHIRPLED
- CHAIRS (positions 4-9)
- QUORUMS (positions 10-16)
- FLAMINGO (positions 17-24)
- PUSH (positions 25-28)
- CONVEX (positions 29-34)
- OF → likely not a separate word
- WE → connector
- WHIRLED (positions 37-43)... wait: ...OFWEHIRPLED
  
  Better parsing: ZXPCHAIRS|QUORUMS|FLAMINGO|PUSH|CONVEX|OFWE|HIRPLED

  Or: Z, X, P, **CHAIRS**, **QUORUMS**, **FLAMINGO**, **PUSH**, **CONVEX**, OF, WE, **HIRPLED**
  
  Known hidden words: **CHAIRS, QUORUMS, FLAMINGO, PUSH, CONVEX, WHIRLED**
  (Per knowledge base research — confirmed words)
  
  Wait — rereading: ...CONVEXOFWEHIRPLED
  - CONVEX + OF + W + E + HIRPLED
  - Or: CONVEX + OF + WHIRLED (rearranged?) 
  - HIRPLED = to limp/hobble (Scottish word) — IS a real word!
  
  So the 6 hidden words are: **CHAIRS, QUORUMS, FLAMINGO, PUSH, CONVEX, HIRPLED**

**Solving Approach:**
1. The character string contains hidden words separated by "junk" letters
2. The junk letters (Z, X, P, OF, WE) may form additional information
3. The RED and BLUE sections of the geodesic spheres indicate specific triangular faces
4. Map the 6 hidden words to specific sphere faces/sections
5. The red-highlighted letters (X, A) in the string may be the final extraction
6. Red sphere + Blue sphere → two different operations on the words

**The geodesic spheres** likely represent a mapping system where each face/section corresponds to a letter or position. The colored sections tell you which faces to read.

**Status:** One of the hardest puzzles. Community has identified the 6 hidden words but the sphere-to-answer extraction is debated.

## 4. META-CLUE WORD MAPPING

| Position | Length | Confirmed Word | Source Puzzle |
|----------|--------|---------------|---------------|
| 1 | 5 | EVERY | ? |
| 2 | 9 | CHALLENGE | ? |
| 3 | 5 | LEADS | ? |
| 4 | 7 | TOWARDS | ? |
| 5 | 8 | LOCATION | ? |
| 6 | 4 | NAME | ? |
| 7 | 9 | SOMEWHERE | ? |
| 8 | 6 | AROUND | ? |
| 9 | 5 | WORLD | ? |

**Each puzzle yields one word. The 9 puzzles in playlist order map to these 9 slots.**

The playlist ORDER determines which puzzle → which word position. We need to confirm the video playlist order to know which puzzle gives which word.

## 13. PUZZLE SOLVING PROGRESS

### PUZZLE 2 — SUDOKU: ✅ GRID SOLVED

**Completed Grid:**
```
Row 1: A L F | C H N | E G I 
Row 2: C G H | F I E | N L A 
Row 3: E I N | A G L | H F C 
      -------------------------
Row 4: G N L | H E I | C A F 
Row 5: I H C | L F A | G E N 
Row 6: F A E | G N C | I H L 
      -------------------------
Row 7: H F A | N C G | L I E 
Row 8: N E G | I L F | A C H 
Row 9: L C I | E A H | F N G 
```

**Extraction Status:** Grid solved but extraction method uncertain. Need to determine which cells to read. Likely involves the blue CHANGE/LIFE labels indicating specific rows/columns/cells to extract from.

### PUZZLE 3 — TEAMSEAS: 🔄 IN PROGRESS

**Best-fit TV show identifications:**
| # | Genre/Years | Best Guess | Confidence |
|---|------------|------------|------------|
| 1 | Action, 1982-1986 & 2008-2009 | KNIGHT RIDER | HIGH |
| 2 | Animated, 2002-2007 | KIM POSSIBLE | HIGH |
| 3 | Animated, 2021-2024 | INSIDE JOB | MEDIUM |
| 4 | Anthology, 2019-2021 | TWO SENTENCE HORROR STORIES or INTO THE DARK | MEDIUM |
| 5 | Automotive, 1977-2001 & 2002-2022 | TOP GEAR | HIGH |
| 6 | Children's, 1992-1996 | BARNEY AND FRIENDS or GHOSTWRITER | LOW |
| 7 | Comedy, 1965-1970 | GET SMART | HIGH |
| 8 | Comedy, 1965-1971 | GREEN ACRES or HOGAN'S HEROES | MEDIUM |
| 9 | Comedy, 1984-1992 & 2023-2025 | NIGHT COURT | HIGH |
| 10 | Comedy, 1995-1998 | CYBILL or NEWSRADIO | MEDIUM |
| 11 | Comedy, 2000-2006 | MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE | HIGH |
| 12 | Crime drama, 2003-2004 | DRAGNET or THREAT MATRIX | LOW |
| 13 | Espionage, 2007-2013 | BURN NOTICE | HIGH |
| 14 | Game show, 2005-2020 | DEAL OR NO DEAL | MEDIUM |
| 15 | Mystery, 2019-2022 | NANCY DREW or PRODIGAL SON | MEDIUM |
| 16 | Reality, 2010-present | MASTERCHEF | MEDIUM |
| 17 | Reality, 2024-present | BEAST GAMES | HIGH |
| 18 | Soap, 1979-1993 | KNOTS LANDING | HIGH |
| 19 | Superhero, 2017-2018 | INHUMANS or THE GIFTED or RUNAWAYS | LOW |

**Key Bottleneck:** Need to correctly identify ALL 19 shows AND understand debris removal mechanism before extraction can work. The (row,col) coordinates and debris pool interaction is the critical puzzle mechanic.

### PUZZLE 4 — STENCIL LOCATIONS: 🔄 IN PROGRESS

**Identified place names (partial):**
- COLFAX — real place (many in US)
- DOVERCOURT — real place (Toronto, Essex UK)
- ALVISO (from AALVISO) — real neighborhood in San Jose, CA
- WASCANA (from WASCANY?) — real place in Regina, Saskatchewan
- McGREGOR (from CLOMCGREGOY?) — real place name

**Working Theory:** Each name plate contains a real neighborhood/suburb name with extra letters injected. The extra letters spell the answer. Color coding may indicate grouping or reading order.

### PUZZLE 5 — POKÉMON CAGE MAZE: 🔄 IN PROGRESS

**Pokédex numbers confirmed.** Need to:
1. Look up each Pokémon name
2. Plot bars on grid to form cage walls
3. Identify blue-cell extraction letters
4. Trace escape path OR extract from blue cells

### PUZZLE 6 — TENTS AND TREES: 🔄 NOT STARTED
Standard logic puzzle. Solvable with patience. Need to complete placement then determine extraction.

### PUZZLE 7 — 100 DOGS VENN DIAGRAM: 🔄 NOT STARTED
Need high-resolution image to count each dog's 5 attributes. Errata: dog at row 6, col 6 no longer wags tail.

### PUZZLE 8 — PYRAMID CROSSWORD: 🔄 PARTIALLY SOLVED
Many individual clues solved (see Puzzle 8 section above). Need to complete grid and determine extraction cells.

### PUZZLE 9 — GEODESIC CIPHER: 🔄 IN PROGRESS
Hidden words identified: CHAIRS, QUORUMS, FLAMINGO, PUSH, CONVEX, HIRPLED. 
Sphere face mapping needed. Red/blue highlighted sections indicate extraction.

### PUZZLE 1 — WORD SEARCH: 🔄 NOT STARTED
Need to solve clues, find words in grid, identify water droplet positions for extraction.

## 14. IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS (PRIORITIZED)

1. **Get higher-resolution images** of all puzzles (especially word search, Pokémon cage bars, dogs)
2. **Confirm video playlist ORDER** — this determines which puzzle → which meta-clue position
3. **Research TV show identifications** for TeamSeas puzzle (especially low-confidence ones)
4. **Solve Tents & Trees** puzzle completely (mechanical logic solve)
5. **Count dog attributes** for Venn diagram puzzle (tedious but doable)
6. **Research stencil font neighborhoods** to identify base names and extract extra letters
7. **Use Slackbot** to get puzzle-specific hints via Puzzle Cards
8. **Check social media** for MrBeast/Salesforce/Lone Shark Games clues (Hint #5)

## 15. SLACKBOT/BEASTBOT INTEL (Feb 14, 2026)

### Confirmed by BeastBot:
- Sudoku puzzle = **WORDOKU** ("a sudoku with letters; some row, column, or diagonal spells a word")
- Pokémon puzzle = **CRISSCROSS** ("a grid where words are placed reading L-R and T-B")
- Pokémon hint: **"They are mainly found in Asia"** (may indicate regional Pokédex)
- **"$1 to $500K Experiences" goes with BANK VIDEO SCREEN 2** (dual-purpose: Stage 0 + Stage 1)
- Word search puzzle (100 Wells) identified as **word search** type

### Confirmed by Slackbot:

**TeamSeas:**
- "Yes. Remove the debris letters from each full show title first, then use the cleaned titles to extract letters at the (row,col) positions"
- Per-title debris removal CONFIRMED (but shared pool produces better results computationally)
- If title becomes shorter than requested column = wrong show ID or wrong method

**Pokémon Cage Bars:**
- "That sounds like a reasonable interpretation"
- Use Pokédex # → Pokémon name → plot on grid → extract blue-shaded cell letters
- Check regional dex numbering (Asia hint from BeastBot!)
- If name longer than bar, check for wrapping/truncation

**Geodesic Spheres:**
- Red and blue sphere sections act as SELECTORS picking specific letters from hidden words
- Extract red-letters and blue-letters as TWO SEPARATE STREAMS
- Streams may interleave, index into each other, or use cipher transformation

**Experiences Puzzle:**
- Colors could indicate extraction order (group by color, extract in color sequence)
- Stencil fonts may indicate "missing strokes or extra marks"
- Place-name hypothesis worth testing (remove letters to find known place)
- Track "superfluous" letters across plates for separate message

**General:**
- 500 character limit per Slackbot message
- Slackbot won't confirm specific answers
- Creating Puzzle Cards BEFORE asking gives much better responses
- BeastBot auto-identifies puzzle types when you create cards

## 16. REVISED TEAMSEAS ANALYSIS

### Extraction from raw titles (no debris removal):
Using (show#, position) directly into show titles (spaces removed, 1-indexed):
**IDCWGSTERNOTWTSIGSA** (19 letters)

After removing debris pool from this string: **EOWTS**

### The Problem:
- Per-title debris removal strips titles down to 1-3 letters (too aggressive)
- Shared-pool debris removal is order-dependent
- Several TV show IDs remain uncertain
- The extraction string doesn't form obvious words yet

### TV Shows Needing Research:
| # | Genre/Years | Current Guess | Problem |
|---|------------|---------------|---------|
| 3 | Animated, 2021-2024 | INSIDE JOB (2021-2022) | End date doesn't match |
| 6 | Children's, 1992-1996 | BARNEY AND FRIENDS (1992-2010) | End date way off |
| 10 | Comedy, 1995-1998 | NEWSRADIO (1995-1999) | End date off by 1 |
| 12 | Crime drama, 2003-2004 | COLD CASE (2003-2010) | End date way off |
| 15 | Mystery, 2019-2022 | NANCY DREW (2019-2023) | End date off by 1 |
| 19 | Superhero, 2017-2018 | INHUMANS (2017 only) | End date off |

### Key Insight:
The puzzle is likely solvable only with exact TV show matches. Every wrong show changes the extraction letter. This requires systematic TV database research for exact genre + year matches.
