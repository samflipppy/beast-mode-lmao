## 🔄 STAGE 1 — CURRENT FOCUS (50 Location Puzzles)

### Hub 1: The 9 Playlist Puzzles (Dual Purpose)
Each Stage 0 puzzle ALSO yields a Stage 1 location-name answer. This is separate from the meta-clue word.
- **No confirmed Stage 1 location answers publicly reported**
- The puzzles serve dual purpose: one answer feeds meta-clue, another answer is a location name

### Hub 2: Super Bowl Commercial "The Vault"
~3,476 frames of clues. Key identified elements:

### Hub 3: Red Herring Bank Video

- Known mapping: Experiences puzzle = Screen 2; Jar of Pennies = Screen 11
- Computer screens are used ONCE each
- Bank video was released BEFORE Super Bowl but needs ad content

### Hub 4: Gifts to Friends

## IMMEDIATE PRIORITY ACTIONS

### 🔴 HIGHEST PRIORITY (Stage 1 Focus):
1. **Decode the QR code** from Super Bowl ad (try scanning the frame)
2. **Read the 2026 calendar circled dates** — zoom into bank video frame at ~29s
3. **Research the withdrawal slip numbers** — 650-283-9795 is a phone number; 5480-234-354 needs decoding
4. **Ask Slackbot** about specific ad elements: "Is [element] a puzzle?"
5. **Try submitting location guesses** for obvious clues (LAS VEGAS, LOS ANGELES, etc.)

### 🟡 HIGH PRIORITY:
6. **Check social media** for clues (Hint #5) — MrBeast, Salesforce, Lone Shark Games
7. **Join Discord** (discord.gg/beastforce67) for community intel on Stage 1
8. **Solve remaining Stage 0 extraction details** — to get Stage 1 location answers from each
9. **Analyze the Salesforce platform UI** from salesforcead frames for puzzle structure clues

### 🟢 MEDIUM PRIORITY:
10. **Analyze behind-the-scenes photos** for undecoded cipher elements
11. **Investigate gift puzzle** — who received gifts, what's inside
12. **Work on Stage 2 crossword** with available clues
13. **Phone number research** — call the numbers, check for recorded messages

## WINNING STRATEGY SUMMARY

```
Phase 1: COMPLETE Stage 0 → Know all answers are LOCATIONS ✅
Phase 2: Solve Stage 1 → Find 50+ location names from 3 hubs + gifts  ← WE ARE HERE
Phase 3: Feed locations into Stage 2 crossword → Get 11-word meta-answer
Phase 4: Use meta-answer to unlock Stage 3+
Phase 5: Extract final vault code
Phase 6: Slack the code to @MrBeast → WIN $1,000,000
```

### Key Insight: The bottleneck is Stage 1.
Nobody is "even close" to winning because Stage 1 requires solving 50 puzzles across
multiple media (video frames, audio, images, real-world locations). The bank video ↔
computer screen mapping is where everyone is stuck.

### Our Competitive Edge:
- We have the complete Stage 0 solution
- We have detailed Slackbot intel
- We can build automated tools (frame extraction, cipher decoders)
- We can systematically research every ad element for location connections

## QUESTIONS TO ASK SLACKBOT NEXT

### Stage 1 Questions:
1. "I found a violation ticket in the Super Bowl ad dated 02/11/24 from LAS VEGAS. Is LAS VEGAS one of the 50 location answers?"
2. "The BARCLAY HOTEL at 103 W 4th St LA 90013 appears in the ad. Is this a Stage 1 puzzle? What location should I extract?"
3. "How many Salesforce computer lab screens are there in total? Is there a way to see all screens?"
4. "The emoji sequence 🎠🦕🎡⚓🏕️ — does each emoji represent a separate location puzzle?"

### Process Questions:
5. "I have the 9-word meta-clue. What do I do next? Do I need all 50 location answers before Stage 2 opens?"
6. "For Stage 1, are the 9 playlist puzzles the same puzzles that give the meta-clue words, or separate puzzles?"
7. "Do I submit individual location answers somewhere, or only the final vault code?"

## NOTES ON PUZZLE DESIGN (Lone Shark Games Patterns)
- Mike Selinker designs puzzles that are "very hard and lots of steps"
- Past hunts feature layered extraction (solve puzzle → intermediate → solve again)
- "Direct way through" exists per Hint #1 — suggests not ALL 50 puzzles needed
- Puzzles within puzzles (meta-puzzles) are a Lone Shark hallmark
- 27 days of production → number 27 may be significant
- Lone Shark: "Not all of the puzzle has been revealed" — more content dropping over time
- MrBeast: "No one is even close" — suggests multiple unsolved stages remain
