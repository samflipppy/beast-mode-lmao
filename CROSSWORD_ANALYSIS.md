## KEY OBSERVATIONS

### 1. Circled Squares
The grid contains CIRCLES in specific cells. These likely spell the 11-word meta-answer
when read in order. We need a high-res grid to map all circle positions.

### 2. MrBeast-Specific Clues
Several clues directly reference MrBeast content:
- 40D: Silverbyte on "MrBeast Lab" → FRED (Tatasciore)
- 49D: jacksepticeye → IRISH
- 69D: $10K sushi vs $10 sushi → MrBeast video
- 90A: Fridge Interview conductor → YouTube/MrBeast
- 141A: Lloyd Cadena → Filipino vlogger
- 145A: Moon Hyeon-jun (Oner) → esports
- 165A: Team Trees/Seas/Water amounts
- 171A: Sandwich with Bayashi → MrBeast collab

### 3. Linked Clues
- 140D: "See 33-Down" → both are blank, will unlock together
- 116D: "School where they also say 95-Down" → 95D is blank

### 4. The Final Code
The submission UI shows two fields: `12345678` and `12345678` with "Submit Final Answer"
The vault code appears to be TWO 8-digit numbers (or one 16-digit code).
