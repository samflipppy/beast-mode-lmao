## 2. CONFIRMED PUZZLE ARCHITECTURE

### Stage 0: The 9-Word Meta-Clue (ENTRY POINT)
- **Source:** Playlist of 9 past MrBeast YouTube videos
- **Mechanism:** Each video has a pinned comment → links to a variety puzzle on Reddit
- **Each puzzle yields ONE word** → 9 words form a sentence IN ORDER
- **Confirmed word lengths:** 5, 9, 5, 7, 8, 4, 9, 6, 5
- **Purpose:** "Defines the nature of the search" — it's an INSTRUCTION
- **Getting this clue = "the first step on your journey"**

#### LEADING THEORY for the 9-word clue (from redherringbank.com wiki):
> **"EVERY CHALLENGE LEADS TOWARDS LOCATION NAME SOMEWHERE AROUND WORLD"**
> (5-9-5-7-8-4-9-6-5) ✓ matches letter counts

This implies: **All 50 Stage 1 puzzle answers are LOCATION NAMES** (place names)

#### Competing Theories:
- **Theory A (Signal-First):** "AGENT PROCESSES _____ _______ ELEPHANT WITH _______ UNLOCK PRIZE"
- **Theory B (Sampling-First):** Similar to A with different slots 3, 4, 7
- **Theory C (Location Theory):** "EVERY CHALLENGE LEADS TOWARDS LOCATION NAME SOMEWHERE AROUND WORLD" ← **strongest candidate per wiki**

Seven of nine words are considered "strong anchors" by the community.

### Stage 1: The 50 Puzzles (3 Hubs + Gifts)
**ALL 50 answers are the same type** (likely location names per the meta-clue). If your answer isn't that type, you're not done.

#### Hub 1: Video Playlist (Stage 0 puzzles)
- 9 variety puzzles linked from pinned comments on 9 past MrBeast videos
- Example: Sudoku variant using letters in LIF(E)CHANGE instead of numbers (from "Changing the Lives of 600 Strangers" video)
- Solving the grid alone isn't enough — you need additional info to know which letters to extract
- "Tens of thousands of solutions" submitted, community has mostly cracked these

#### Hub 2: The Super Bowl Commercial ("The Vault")
- 30-second ad, ~3,476 frames
- **"Almost everything Jimmy passes by is a clue"**
- **"Look up, down, forward, backward, and behind the scenes"**
- **"Figure out how to get an answer from each weird thing"**
- "Some of these puzzles use codes you can find online" (standard ciphers: A1Z26, Morse, Braille, semaphore, phone keypad, etc.)
- Many solutions found, but several puzzles are still eluding solvers

#### Hub 3: The Red Herring Bank Video
- Released BEFORE Super Bowl — intentionally made extra hard
- **CRITICAL:** Each screen in the Salesforce computer lab maps 1:1 to one clue in the bank video
- Each screen used ONLY ONCE
- Bank puzzles are ONLY solvable using content from the Super Bowl ad as inputs
- This is where most solvers are stuck

#### The Gifts
- Jimmy gave gifts to a number of his friends
- Most look like the photo on the /behindthescenes/ page (golden gift boxes?)
- A poster exists somewhere showing who got a gift
- Gift answers are the same type as all Stage 1 answers (location names)
- **All gift answers can be combined to get ANOTHER answer** — "you just have to figure out how"

### 51st Puzzle: The Crossword
- Dropped by puzzlemaster Mike Selinker in a behind-the-scenes video
- Was a gift to Jimmy
- **Key to STAGE 2**
- Originally had no clues — clues fill in as community makes progress
- As of Feb 11: many clue slots filled, some still blank
- Clue 167A: "What this puzzle commemorates in eleven words in the theme entries" — this is the meta-answer
- Circled letters in the grid may be significant

### Stage 2+
- At least 2 more stages beyond Stage 1
- Crossword is the bridge to Stage 2
- "More on that another day" — details being revealed over time
- The crossword's theme entries spell an 11-word phrase

## 14. THE 3 COMPETING META-CLUE THEORIES (Detailed)

### Theory A: Signal-First
> **AGENT PROCESSES AUDIO SIGNALS ELEPHANT WITH SLACKBOTS UNLOCK PRIZE**
> (5-9-5-7-8-4-9-6-5) ✓

### Theory B: Sampling-First  
> **AGENT PROCESSES CODES SAMPLES ELEPHANT WITH STAIRWELL UNLOCK PRIZE**
> (5-9-5-7-8-4-9-6-5) ✓

### Theory C: Location Theory ← **STRONGEST per wiki**
> **EVERY CHALLENGE LEADS TOWARDS LOCATION NAME SOMEWHERE AROUND WORLD**

**Anchor words** (shared across theories A & B): AGENT, PROCESSES, ELEPHANT, WITH, UNLOCK, PRIZE
**Debated slots:** 3 (5 letters), 4 (7 letters), 7 (9 letters)

Theory C is fundamentally different — proposes every word is geographic in nature. Supported by:

- Reddit detectives speculate the final answer points to this physical location
- **NOT OFFICIALLY CONFIRMED** — remains one of several theories
- The Location Theory meta-clue ("EVERY CHALLENGE LEADS TOWARDS LOCATION NAME SOMEWHERE AROUND WORLD") would support the final answer being a specific geographic location
