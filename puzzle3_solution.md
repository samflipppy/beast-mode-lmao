## How the Puzzle Works

### Mechanic (3 steps):
1. **Identify** all 19 TV shows from their genre + year range
2. **Remove exactly 2 debris letters** from each show title → the remaining letters anagram to the corresponding After Cleanup clue answer
3. **Extract** the 2 removed letters using the (position₁, position₂) coordinates → each clue yields a 2-letter pair

### Final Extraction:
The 19 pairs (38 letters) spell a phrase:

> **AT ER MF OR CH IE FR OL ES OR ME TA LS WI TH SY MB OL PB**  
> → "A TERM FOR CHIEF ROLES OR METALS WITH SYMBOL PB"  
> → **LEADS** (Pb = lead; chief roles = leads)
