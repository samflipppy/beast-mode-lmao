## CRITICAL: Hidden Letters Under Water Droplets
The 17 dot positions contain letters HIDDEN UNDER water droplet markers. Without the original
high-res image, we can't read those letters. Every cell in a word search has a letter.
The dots are NOT empty cells — they're extraction markers ON TOP of letters.

## Extraction Method
- Find all 12 words in the grid (8 directions)
- Water droplet markers indicate which cells to read
- Read marked letters in order (likely left-to-right, top-to-bottom) → EVERY

## What We Still Need
- Higher resolution image to see if dots are water droplets on letters
- Confirm all 12 word answers
- Determine if Stage 1 location answer comes from same puzzle or different extraction
- Check if image filename contains a cipher (per Reddit suggestion)
