## Slackbot Intel
- "This bank video puzzle goes with screen 2" — HUGE: connects to bank video
- Colors could indicate extraction order (group by color, extract in sequence)
- "Stencil fonts may indicate missing strokes or extra marks"
- "If plates look like real place names with extra letters, test by removing one or more letters to see if a known place emerges"
- "Track which letters seem superfluous across plates"

## Approach
1. For each plate, identify the real place/neighborhood name
2. The "extra" letters not part of real names → read in order → TOWARDS
3. Colors may determine the reading order of extra letters

## Known Real Places
- COLFAX — real neighborhood/town (many US cities)
- DOVERCOURT — Toronto neighborhood
- ALVISO (from AALVISO) — San Jose, CA neighborhood
- WASCANA (from WASCANY?) — Regina, Saskatchewan
- McGREGOR (from CLOMCGREGOY?) — various locations

## What We Still Need
- Higher resolution image
- Identify ALL real place names in each plate
- Determine color → extraction order mapping
- Find the Stage 1 location answer (linked to Bank Video Screen 2)
