## Slackbot Intel
- "This bank video puzzle goes with screen 2" — HUGE: connects to bank video
- Colors could indicate extraction order (group by color, extract in sequence)
- "Stencil fonts may indicate missing strokes or extra marks"
- "If plates look like real place names with extra letters, test by removing one or more letters to see if a known place emerges"
- "Track which letters seem superfluous across plates"

## Approach
1. For each plate, identify the real place/neighborhood name
2. The "extra" letters not part of real names → read in order → TOWARDS
3. Colors may determine the reading order of extra letters

## What We Still Need
- Higher resolution image from ImageShack
- Identify remaining 5 unresolved plates (6, 8, 12, 16, 19)
- Verify color → extraction order mapping
- Cross-reference with Bank Video Screen 2 for Stage 1 location answer
- Test if first letters of all place names spell something
