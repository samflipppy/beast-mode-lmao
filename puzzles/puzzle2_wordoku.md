# Puzzle 2: Wordoku — "Changing the Lives of 600 Strangers"

## Basic Info
- **Source:** Reddit — reddit.com/user/BeastForce67/comments/1qxxmdn/puzzle/
- **Video:** "Changing the Lives of 600 Strangers" (Beast Philanthropy)
- **Puzzle Type:** Wordoku (Sudoku with letters LIFECHANGE)
- **Meta-Clue Word:** CHALLENGE (9 letters) — ✅ CONFIRMED
- **Stage 1 Answer:** Unknown location name
- **BeastBot Response:** "This is likely a wordoku"

## Puzzle Description
A standard 9x9 Sudoku grid using the 9 letters L-I-F-E-C-H-A-N-G (from LIFECHANGE, with E appearing once). Labels: CHANGE across the bottom (6 columns), LIFE down the right side (4 rows).

## Solved Grid
The complete Sudoku grid has been solved (all cells filled). The extraction method is a zigzag pattern between columns 3 and 4, reading top to bottom.

## Extraction Method — CONFIRMED
- Zigzag between columns 3 and 4 down the grid
- This spells: C-H-A-L-L-E-N-G-E = **CHALLENGE**
- Confirmed by Reddit user Novembur_ and community

## Key Intel
- Reddit comments confirmed the zigzag extraction method
- User joescalon: "the answer is to find the pattern, or what pattern is missing"
- User RandomUser6521 suggested checking image filenames for ciphers
- No shading or marking inside the grid itself — the extraction is purely positional

## Slackbot Responses
- BeastBot: "This is likely a wordoku. A wordoku is a sudoku with letters."
- Slackbot: "Inspect any labeled rows, columns, or colored regions and try reading letters from the cells those labels reference"
- Slackbot: "CHANGE and LIFE labels might mark two separate reading orders"
