- **Video:** "$10,000 Every Day You Survive in the Wilderness"
- **Puzzle Type:** Tents and Trees logic puzzle
- **Meta-Clue Word:** SOMEWHERE (9 letters) — Community-accepted
- **Stage 1 Answer:** Unknown location name
- **BeastBot Response:** Confirmed as puzzle

## Puzzle Description
Standard Tents & Trees puzzle: Place exactly one tent horizontally or vertically adjacent to each tree. Numbers along edges indicate how many tents in each row/column. No two tents touch (even diagonally).

## Key Intel
- Community has noted this puzzle has "at least two valid solutions"
- This suggests either a puzzle flaw OR (more likely) a unique extraction method that yields the same answer from both solutions
- The double-solution property is likely intentional (Lone Shark Games design)

## Extraction Method
- Solve the Tents & Trees grid
- Extract letters from tent positions (tents placed on a letter grid?)
- Or: tent positions map to coordinates that spell SOMEWHERE
- The fact that both valid solutions give the same answer confirms correctness

## What We Still Need
- Higher resolution image to see grid numbers and tree positions
- Solve the logic puzzle (two valid solutions exist)
- Determine extraction method (tent positions → letters?)
- Stage 1 location answer

## Slackbot Questions To Ask
- "For the Tents & Trees puzzle from 'Survive in the Wilderness', I found two valid tent placements. Is the extraction the same from both solutions?"
- "After placing tents, do the tent positions map to letters on an underlying grid to spell the answer?"
