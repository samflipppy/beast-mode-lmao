- **Video:** "I Adopted 100 Dogs!"
- **Puzzle Type:** Venn diagram with 5 dog attributes

- **Stage 1 Answer:** Unknown location name
- **BeastBot Response:** Confirmed as puzzle

## Puzzle Description
100 cartoon dogs in a 10x10 grid. Each dog has a combination of 5 binary attributes. A 5-circle Venn diagram on the left has letters in each of its 32 regions.

## The 5 Attributes (Questions)
1. Whose ears are up?
2. Who's got a toy bone?
3. Who's got spots?
4. Who's wearing a collar?
5. Who's wiggling their tail?

## IMPORTANT ERRATA
BeastForce67 posted: "Please note: this file has changed since the initial upload. The sixth doggo in the sixth row is no longer wagging their tail."

## Venn Diagram
- 5 overlapping circles = 32 possible regions (2^5 = 32, including "none of the above")
- Each region contains a letter
- Letters visible include: S, E, K, W (outer regions), L (center where all 5 overlap), and others
- Need higher-res image to read all 32 letters

## Extraction Method (Likely)
1. For each of the 100 dogs, determine which of the 5 attributes it has
2. This places each dog into one of 32 Venn regions
3. Count how many dogs are in each region
4. Use the count as an index or mapping to the letter in that region
5. Extract letters to spell NAME (4 letters)

## Community
- Comment from MrBeastHunt: "We solved this already, join the server discord.gg/beastforce67"
- This suggests the community Discord has the solution

## What We Still Need
- Higher resolution image to:
  - Read all 32 Venn diagram letters
  - Clearly see each dog's attributes (ears, bone, spots, collar, tail)
- Account for the errata (dog 6 in row 6 no longer wagging tail)
- Stage 1 location answer

## Slackbot Questions To Ask
- "For the 100 Dogs Venn diagram, I count dogs per Venn region and use the letter in that region. The errata says dog 6 row 6 changed. Do I count dogs per region to spell the answer?"
- "Is the extraction: count dogs in each region → use count as alphabet index, or just read the letter in each occupied region?"
