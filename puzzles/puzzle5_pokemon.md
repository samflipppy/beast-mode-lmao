## Basic Info
- **Source:** Photobucket — photobucket.com/share/753ba093-2a25-4fd1-a061-5d199c5bda49
- **Video:** "Pokémon Go Stereotypes"
- **Puzzle Type:** Cage bar crisscross (Pokédex numbers → names on grid → blue cell extraction)
- **Meta-Clue Word:** LOCATION (8 letters) — Community-accepted
- **Stage 1 Answer:** Unknown location name
- **BeastBot Response:** "This is likely a crisscross. They are mainly found in Asia."

## Puzzle Description
A grid with numbered cage bars. Each number is a Pokédex entry. Place the Pokémon name along its bar (one letter per cell). Extract letters from blue-shaded cells.

## Key Intel
- BeastBot confirmed: "crisscross" type where Pokémon names interlock on grid
- BeastBot: "They are mainly found in Asia" — suggests regional Pokédex
- Slackbot confirmed: "That sounds like a reasonable interpretation" for blue-cell extraction
- Use regional Pokédex (not National) since BeastBot specified Asia

## Extraction Method (Confirmed by Slackbot)
1. Each cage bar number → Pokédex entry → Pokémon name
2. Place Pokémon name along the bar, one letter per cell
3. Names interlock like a crossword (crisscross)
4. Extract letters from BLUE-shaded cells
5. Blue cell letters spell: LOCATION

## Regional Pokédex Question
- Numbers range from 138 to 1006
- "Mainly found in Asia" could mean: Kitakami (Japan), Hisui (ancient Japan), or Paldea
- Kitakami dex only has ~200 entries, so numbers >200 wouldn't work
- May need National Dex after all, with the "Asia" hint being about the Pokémon types

## Slackbot Questions To Ask
- "For the Pokémon cage bars, I placed names using National Dex numbers. The blue cells spell LOCATION. Is this the correct Stage 0 extraction?"
- "For the Stage 1 answer from this puzzle, do I need a different extraction from the same grid? The answer should be a location name."

## What We Still Need
- Higher resolution image to count exact blue cells
- Confirm which Pokédex (National vs Regional) for each number
- Verify all Pokémon name placements fit the grid
- Stage 1 location answer
